/**
 * The Search field creates an HTML5 search input and is usually created inside
 * a form. Because it creates an HTML search input type, the visual styling of
 * this input is slightly different to normal text input contrls (the corners
 * are rounded), though the virtual keyboard displayed by the operating system
 * is the standard keyboard control.
 * 
 * As with all other form fields in Sencha Touch, the search field gains a
 * "clear" button that appears whenever there is text entered into the form, and
 * which removes that text when tapped.
