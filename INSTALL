                         Touch4j 4.0 Installation
                         ------------------------
                         
For any questions or details about Touch4j, please visit us in the forum:

Touch4j 4.0 is distributed as a single Jar file.

Requirements
------------

- Google Web Toolkit 2.4 or higher
- Sencha Touch 2.1
- Java Development Kit 1.6 or higher in your path.
  

Steps
-----

>> Option A: download the Touch4j Kitchen Sink (a GPLv3, Eclipse project) from svn and 
             import it into Eclipse.  You will need to download the touch4j-xxx.jar file
             and add it to the project's classpath.

             http://svn.emitrom.com/gwt4touch2ks/trunk/kitchensink/
    
    
>> Option B: follow all the steps below.

1. Create a new Web Application Project (GWT) project in your IDE. Enter your 
   project's details as appropriate.
   
2. Add the touch4j-xxx.jar file to the project's classpath.

3. Edit your project's .gwt.xml file and leave only the following inherits statements:
     <inherits name="com.emitrom.touch4j.Touch4j" />
     
   In this same file, add the webkit user-agent to speed up compilation:
     <set-property name="user.agent" value="safari" />
          
4. In your GWT .html page, include the following in the <head> section:
     <!-- Fill the device's screen -->
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; minimum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;" />

     <!-- Google Maps support -->
     <script type="text/javascript" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true"></script>
     
   
     <!-- Sencha Touch CSS -->
     <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="{your-project}/touch/resources/css/sencha-touch.css" />
    
     
5. Create a folder called public of your GWT project, and underneath it create a directory 
   called 'touch'; copy the resources and the Sencha .js file into it.  This will allow 
   the instructions in the previous step to work correctly.
    
   
6. Modify your GWT client .java file to extend TouchEntryPoint, instead of implementing
   EntryPoint:
     public class YourGWTProject extends TouchEntryPoint {
         @Override
         public void onLoad() {
            MessageBox.alert("Emitrom","Hello Touch4j");
         }
     }
  
            
Enjoy!
